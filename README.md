# Compelling #

Your blog deserves the best. Bold. Beautiful. Compelling.

## Jetpack Features

Compelling makes use of some of [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) for some of its features. A WordPress.com account is not required for any of Compelling's functionality.

### Social Media Menu

Compelling features a special menu with links to your social media sites in the footer, with icons for the major social media networks. To use this menu, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Dashboard and then go to Appearance > Menus. Create a new menu and name it whatever you'd like.

2. Select "Custom Links" from the accordion menu on the left (where it says "Pages", "Custom Links", and "Categories"), and in the text boxes marked "URL", enter your URL. For example, for Twitter, you would write https://twitter.com/your-twitter-username.

3. Click the "Add to Menu" button. Repeat for every social media network you'd like to add.

4. Once your menu is created, click the "Save Menu" button, and then click on the "Manage Locations" tab near the top of the screen. Assign your newly-created menu to the "Social Menu" location.

## Front Page Template

Compelling includes a special template that can be used to create a unique front page, if you're using a static front page. To use this template, create a new page (or edit an existing page) and select "Front Page Template" from the "Template" dropdown in the "Page Attributes" box. Then, go to Dashboard > Appearance > Customize > Static Front Page, select "A static page", and select that page from the "Front Page" dropdown.
